As the sole backend engineer, I was entrusted with full ownership of the entire backend lifecycle for a high-traffic, real-time consumer platform. My primary focus was on executing high-impact architectural improvements to enhance scalability, reliability, and performance.

Architected and executed a critical, zero-downtime database migration from MongoDB to PostgreSQL, designing the complete data transition strategy and writing custom validation scripts to ensure 100% data integrity for all application data.
▪️ Spearheaded the complete modernization of the backend codebase from legacy JavaScript to TypeScript. This initiative introduced strict type safety, significantly improved code quality and maintainability, and reduced the potential for runtime errors in production.
▪️ Engineered a multi-layer caching mechanism using Redis that successfully reduced database load by over 70% during peak traffic, dramatically improving API response times and overall system resilience.
▪️ Drove continuous platform improvement by optimizing critical database queries, enhancing core API services, and ensuring the overall stability and performance of the platform under high load.
